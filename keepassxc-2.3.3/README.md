### Note about KeePassHTTP
The KeePassHTTP protocol is not a highly secure protocol.
It has a certain flaw which could allow an attacker to decrypt your passwords
should they manage to impersonate the web browser extension from a remote address.
<!--intercept communication between a KeePassHTTP server
and PassIFox/chromeIPass over a network connection -->
(See [here](https://github.com/pfn/keepasshttp/issues/258) and [here](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues/147)).

To minimize the risk, KeePassXC strictly limits communication between itself
and the browser plugin to your local computer (localhost).
This makes your passwords quite safe,
but as with all open source software, use it at your own risk!
