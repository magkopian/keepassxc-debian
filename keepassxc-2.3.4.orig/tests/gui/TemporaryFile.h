/**
 * QTemporaryFile::close() doesn't actually close the file according to
 * http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtemporaryfile.html: "For as long as the
 * QTemporaryFile object itself is not destroyed, the unique temporary file
 * will exist and be kept open internally by QTemporaryFile."
 *
 * This behavior causes issues when running tests on Windows. If the file is
 * not closed, the testSave test will fail due to Access Denied. The
 * auto-reload test also fails from Windows not triggering file change
 * notification because the file isn't actually closed by QTemporaryFile.
 *
 * This class isolates the Windows specific logic that uses QFile to really
 * close the test file when requested to.
