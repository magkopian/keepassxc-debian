.SH COMMANDS

.IP "clip [options] <database> <entry> [timeout]"
Copies the password of a database entry to the clipboard. If multiple entries with the same name exist in different groups, only the password for the first one is going to be copied. For coping the password of an entry in a specific group, the group path to the entry should be specified as well, instead of just the name. Optionally, a timeout in seconds can be specified for automatically clearing the clipboard.

.IP "entropy-meter [-a pwd1 pwd2 ...]"
Calculates the entropy of a single, or multiple passwords specified using the \fI-a\fP option. If no passwords are specified, the program will run in interactive mode and prompt the user to enter a password.

.IP "extract [options] <database>"

.IP "locate [options] <database> <term>"
Locates all the entries that match a specific search term in a database.

.IP "ls [options] <database> [group]"
Lists the contents of a group in a database. If no group is specified, it will default to the root group.

.IP "merge [options] <database1> <database2>"
Merges two databases together. The first database file is going to be replaced by the result of the merge, for that reason it is advisable to keep a backup of the two database files before attempting a merge. In the case that both databases make use of the same credentials, the \fI--same-credentials\fP or \fI-s\fP option can be used.

Shows the title, username, password, URL and notes of a database entry. Regarding the occurrence of multiple entries with the same name in different groups, everything stated in the \fIclip\fP command section also applies here.
